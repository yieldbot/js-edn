## Features

* Parse and stringify functions are transitive
* edn equality
* Extensible type system
* Tagged element dispatch hooks
* Robust Jison grammar
* ES5 compatibility

## Installation

Via npm.

```
npm install git://github.com/josh/js-edn.git
```

### To build

Install required modules

```
npm install
```

Run lint, build new edn.js file, run tests.

```
npm run build
```

**NOTE** At the moment, this package is not officially published to npm. I don't have any long term plans of maintaining this package.

For use in a browser, you can just download the [edn.js](https://github.com/josh/js-edn/blob/master/edn.js) file. There aren't any external dependencies.

```
curl -O https://raw.github.com/josh/js-edn/master/edn.js
```

## Usage

### parse

`edn.parse(str)` parses a String into primitive, tagged and wrapped objects. The returned value should contain all the original type information, so passing it into the stringify function, should yield an equivalent result.

``` javascript
edn.parse('["foo" :bar 123]')
// => edn.vector([
//      'foo',
//      edn.keyword('bar'),
//      123
//    ])
```

### stringify

`edn.stringify(obj)` converts the object into an edn String.

``` javascript
edn.stringify(["foo", edn.keyword('bar'), 123])
// => '["foo" :bar 123]'
```

### isEqual

`edn.isEqual(a, b)` compares to objects using [edn semantics](https://github.com/edn-format/edn#equality). For the most part, two values will be equal if they serialize to the same edn string. With the expection of maps and sets which may serialize in a different order.

### valueOf

`edn.valueOf(obj)` attempts to convert the object to primitive values. The returned value will be lossy since tagged objects are discarded for the primitive version. For an example, lists and vectors will be unwrapped into plain old Arrays making it impossible to know the original type. This violates the transitive property of the stringify function. However, built in types may be a little easier to operate on.

``` javascript
edn.valueOf(edn.parse('{:foo "bar", :pi 3.14}'))
// => { foo: 'bar', pi: 3.14 }
```

### types

| type             | edn                  | js                                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------|
| nil              | `nil`                | `null`                                 |
| booleans         | `true`               | `true`                                 |
| strings          | `"hello"`            | `"hello"`                              |
| characters       | `\c`                 | `edn.character('c')`                   |
| symbols          | `?c`                 | `edn.symbol('?c')`                     |
| keywords         | `:name`              | `edn.keyword('name')`                  |
| integers         | `42`                 | `42`                                   |
| floats           | `3.14`               | `edn.float(3.14)`                      |
| lists            | `(1 2 3)`            | `edn.list([1, 2, 3])`                  |
| vectors          | `[1 2 3]`            | `edn.vector([1, 2, 3])`                |
| maps             | `{:foo "bar"}`       | `edn.map([edn.keyword('foo'), "bar"])` |
| sets             | `#{1 2 3}`           | `edn.set([1, 2 ,3])`                   |
| tagged elements  | `#my/foo [3, 4]`     | `edn.unknown('my/foo', [3, 4])`        |


#### nil

`nil` and `null` are equivalents. `undefined` is converted to `null`.

#### booleans

`true` and `true` are equivalents, as well as `false` and `false`. The parser always yields `boolean` primitives.

#### strings

`"hello"` and `"hello"` are equivalents. The parser always yields `string` primitives.

#### characters

`\c` and `edn.character('c')` are equivalents. A character is an `object`, but calling `valueOf` or `toString` will cast it to a `string` primitive. Since there are a limited number of single characters, character objects are interned so two of the same are always reference `==` equal to each other.

#### symbols

`?c` and `edn.symbol('?c')` are equivalents. A symbol is an `object`, but calling `valueOf` or `toString` will cast it to a `string` primitive. Symbols are interned so they are reference `==` equal to each other.

#### keywords

`:foo` and `edn.keyword('foo')` are equivalents. A keyword is an `object`, but calling `valueOf` will cast it to a `string` primitive. Calling `toString` will return a formatted `string` with a leading `:`. Keywords are interned so they are reference `==` equal to each other.

#### integers

`42` and `42` are equivalents. Integer numbers are not tagged. The parser always yeilds `number` primitives.

#### floats

`3.14` and `edn.float(3.14)` are equivalents. Floats are tagged so `6` and `6.0` can be distinguish. A float is an `object`, but calling `valueOf` will cast it to a `number` primitive. Float objects are not intered so, two float objects are not strictly equal.

#### lists

`(1 2 3)` and `edn.list([1, 2, 3])` are equivalents. Lists are tagged Arrays so you can access them as you'd expect.

#### vectors

`[1 2 3]` and `edn.vector([1, 2, 3])` are equivalents. Vectors are tagged Arrays so you can access them as you'd expect.

#### maps

`{:foo "bar"}` and `edn.map([edn.keyword('foo'), "bar"])` are equivalents. The Map object is a backported version of the proposed Harmony Map. A native Map may be returned in the future.

#### sets

`#{1 2 3}` and `edn.set([1, 2, 3])` are equivalents. The Set object is a backported version of the proposed Harmony Set. A native Set may be returned in the future.


## Compatibility
